#idea for codefundo++

**What we are planning to build....**
1. An application (DEEDSFORNEEDS) that will work for the betterment of the people stuck in natural calamities, so that they can be provided with relief at the earliest.
2. The ones common in our country are earthquakes, cyclones/hurricanes, floods, forest fires.



**How does it work..**
1. DEEDSFORNEEDS : An application which is user-friendly with, as simple an interface as possible, which provides transparency to the donation procedure in such disasters. 
The application can display the requirements of the victims & the user can choose whatever category they are willing to donate resources, to. The various requirements can be - flash lights, first-aid kits, water & food packages, help manuals, maps, clothing (&shoes) for extreme weather conditions.

2. Forest Fires -They can be quite unpredictable so they are required to be taken care of separately. For this what we can do is, divide the areas that have dense forests into various segments, each segment being covered by thermal sensors and a central GPS+Communication device. As soon as temperature level rises beyond a particular point which can indicate a fire, the thermal sensors send the intensity data to the central device which can in turn pin-point to the affected location and send the warning to the concerned authorities for prompt action.

**How users can get started ...**
DEEDSFORNEEDS : When the user donates a particular amount through the application, it returns the equivalent number & type of items that have been donated making the process as transparent as possible. 

Fighting Forest Fires : Minimal human intervention requirement.(Just regular maintenance.)

**The technology we will be using....**
Application will be for Windows Platform. (Can be extended across other platforms afterwards)
We will use Java, C, C++(in Microsoft Visual Studio).
