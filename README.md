What we are planning to build....
1. An application (Samadhaan) that will work for the beterement of the people stuck in natural calamities, so that they can be provided with relief at the earliest.
2. The ones common in our country are earthquakes, cyclone/hurricanes, floods, forest fires.



How does it work..
Forest Fires - They can be quite unpredictable so they require to be taken care of separately. For this what we can do is divide the areas that have dense forests into segments, each segment being covered by thermal sensors and a central GPS+Communication device. As soon as heat level rises beyond a paticular point which can indicate a fire, the thermal sensors send the intensity data to the central device which can in turn pin-point to the affected location and send the warning to the concerned authorities for prompt action.
